# Gesture Navigation

## Idea
Often while navigating through webpages or large pdfs (reading), I hate using a mouse to go back, scroll down, or zoom in. I want to be able to perform basic navigation through my desktop using hand gestures.  
Existing models use classification of gestures in static cases, thus enabling 2-D CNNs to be able to recognize the gestures such as point up, thumbs down, victory etc.
